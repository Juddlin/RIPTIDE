# RIPTIDE
RIPTIDE is a system that combines the functionality of GPS tracking and heart rate monitoring in order to provide updates on emergency personnel. It will combine two pre-existing pieces of hardware and format the gathered data through an application. The two pieces of hardware are an Android smartphone capable of GPS tracking and the Jawbone UP2 heart rate monitor. The UP2 will connect to the smartphone using Bluetooth and the RIPTIDE application will capture the data being transferred. Additionally, the application will also collect GPS information from the phoneâ€™s tracking system. RIPTIDE will then take this data, format it as a SMS message and send it to a central server on a user set interval. The user can set the SMS delivery time to be from one minute to ten minutes with 30 second intervals.
